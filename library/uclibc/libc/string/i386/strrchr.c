/*
 * This string-include defines all string functions as inline
 * functions. Use gcc. It also assumes ds=es=data space, this should be
 * normal. Most of the string-functions are rather heavily hand-optimized,
 * see especially strtok,strstr,str[c]spn. They should work, but are not
 * very easy to understand. Everything is done entirely within the register
 * set, making the functions fast and clean. String instructions have been
 * used through-out, making for "slightly" unclear code :-)

 * These make no attempt to use nifty things like mmx/3dnow/etc.
 * These are not inline, and will therefore not be as fast as
 * modifying the headers to use inlines (and cannot therefore
 * do tricky things when dealing with const memory).  But they
 * should (I hope!) be faster than their generic equivalents....
 *
 * More importantly, these should provide a good example for
 * others to follow when adding arch specific optimizations.
