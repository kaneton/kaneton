This directory level abstracts out the kaneton Operating System
dependent features of uClibc for supported kaneton architectures/CPUs.
If you wanted to port uClibc to some new kaneton architecture (arm,
mips, etc), this is the place to add that support.

All the common stuff that is not at all dependent on a particular
kaneton architecture goes in the 'common' directory.
