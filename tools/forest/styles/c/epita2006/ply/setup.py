PLY is yet another implementation of lex and yacc for Python. Although several other
parsing tools are available for Python, there are several reasons why you might
want to take a look at PLY: 

It's implemented entirely in Python. 

It uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars. 

PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for empty 
productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for ambiguous grammars. 

PLY is extremely easy to use and provides very extensive error checking.
