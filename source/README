			----------[ conf ]----------

a kaneton developer has to fill three configuration files located at:

			src/conf/$USER/

---[ $USER.conf

  this file describes the development environment, architecture variables
  compiling variables etc..

---[ modules.conf

  this file lists the files to be loaded by the bootloader

---[ kaneton.conf

  this file describes the kaneton kernel with many parameters

			----------[ env ]----------

a development environment describes binaries, compiling options,
linking options etc.. to use when developing kaneton.

a different environment exists for each operating system. for more information
take a look to the env/ directory.

each environment, directory is composed of one (but can be more) file:

---[ kaneton.mk

  this file describes the makefile dependencies to use to compile the
  kaneton kernel.

  so, you can here specify compile and linking options but also binaries
  to use.

			----------[ make ]----------

first a developer has to install a development environment:

	make init

then he is able to compile:

	make

when finished, the developer then wants to test his kernel either on
another machine or in an emulator, so he has to build a floppy. before all,
he must initialize the boot device with the kaneton boot device format:

	make boot-init

then the developer just has to install the kernel and modules on the boot
device:

	make boot-install

after all, the boot device is ready.

---[ init

syntax:		make init

example:	make init

  this command will create the working environment like scripts, makefiles,
  dependencies etc..

  this script has to be ran before any another make

  note that by default this command will be run if never launched before

---[ clean

syntax:		make clean

example:	make clean

  this command cleans the working environment, which is useful before
  committing or packaging

---[ kaneton

syntax:		make kaneton

example:	make kaneton

  this command will create the kernel, the modules etc..

---[ all

syntax:		make all

example:	make all

  this command will create the kernel, the modules etc..

---[ distclean

syntax:		make distclean

example:	make distclean

  this command will clean the development tree

---[ proto

syntax:		make proto

example:	make proto

  this command will create header prototypes

---[ boot-init

syntax:		make boot-init

example:	make boot-init

  this command will create an initial bootable device

---[ boot-install

syntax:		make boot-install

example:	make boot-install

  this command copies the kernel and modules on the bootable device
