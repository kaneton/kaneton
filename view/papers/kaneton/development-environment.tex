\chapter{Development Environment}

Over the years, the kaneton microkernel evolved, starting with a
very simple introduction to low-level programming and finally
to a complete microkernel development.

Going always further implies many modifications. Indeed, the students
cannot take time to develop their own development environment because
developing a development environment is a whole project by itself.

We wanted to lead students to a complete microkernel development and then
to introduce the parallel and distributed programming. This would not
be possible if they had to develop an entire development environment.

The kaneton development environment in composed of makefiles, shell
scripts and configuration files and together provide multi-users cooperation,
many operating systems, many architectures etc..
