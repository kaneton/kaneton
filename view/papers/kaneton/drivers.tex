\chapter{Drivers}

In this chapter we will overview the kaneton fundamental drivers.

Since drivers are generally highly dependent from the microprocessor's
architecture, we will only describe in this chapter the generic drivers
while specific ones will be describes in architecture-specific papers.

These architecture-specific papers can be found on the official kaneton
website
  \footnote{http://www.kaneton.org}

Recall that, in kaneton terms, a driver is a task which can communicate
with one or more hardware devices.
