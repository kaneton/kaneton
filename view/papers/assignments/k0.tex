\section{k0}

\subsection{Basic rules}

The \textbf{k0} project consists in the development of the bootstrap.

This project is very specific and will not be re-used in the future
projects.

The only  goal is to develop  a bootstrap in assembly,  loading an ELF
binary object from  floppy drive into main memory  and finally jumping
on the binary entry point.

\subsection{IA-32 implementation}

The student will have to install and activate the protected mode before
lauching the binary object.

Moreover, the project's diffculty resides in the development of an
application first evolving in real mode, then in protected mode, all
in a single assembly file.
