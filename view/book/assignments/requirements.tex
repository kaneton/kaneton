\chapter{Requirements}
\label{chapter:requirements}

This chapter discusses the requirements for students to undertake the
\name{kaneton} educational project.

% ---------- text -------------------------------------------------------------

The requirements can be divided into two categories: \term{theoretical} and
\term{practical}. Any student lacking one of the following points should
first make sure he/she has a good knowledge of it before starting the
project.

Note however that students can learn everything along the project though we
recommend a minimum of understanding regarding the operating system principles
and programming languages.

The \name{Opaak} \name{Wiki} accessible at \location{http://kaneton.opaak.org/wiki}
contains resources and references which could be useful to the student
willing to document himself.

\section{Theoretical}

The following topics must be known from every student willing to undertake
the project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \term{Operating Systems Principles} and especially micro-kernel
    architectures;
  \item
    \term{Computer Architectures}.
\end{itemize}

%
% practical
%

\section{Practical}

Since the goal of the project remains to develop a micro-kernel, every
student should be familiar with the programming languages and
development environments the project relies on:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \term{UNIX} environment or your operating system environment --- as
    long as it is supported by the kaneton development environment;
  \item
    \term{C} programming language;
  \item
    \term{Assembly} programming language.
\end{itemize}
