\section{Stop}

Considering that a student has learnt what she wanted to, she could just stop
here.

%
% implementation
%

\section{Implementation}

Another possibility could be for a student to continue her kaneton
implementation by providing higher level functionalities.

% research
%

\section{Research}

A student could also join the kaneton research team and contribute to an
exciting project by thinking differently from people who work on \name{Linux},
\name{BSD} and other \name{UNIX}-like projects.

Indeed, kaneton does not intend to be a \name{UNIX}-like but rather tries to
innovate by considering systems in different ways.

\section{Teaching}

Teaching computer systems through kaneton in a school is another way of
contributing.
