\section{Objectives}

Throughout this project, students will explore the multiple ways of
providing a major operating system feature, being a file system, a
network service or any other feature that has been granted approval by
the teaching board.

Students will have to study the pros and cons of every technique in order to
choose the right algorithms to use for their implementation.

Therefore, in this project, students are free to design and implement whatever
they wish as long as the required feature is eventually provided.

\section{Requirements}

This stage requires a working microkernel.

%
% snapshot
%

\section{Snapshot}

A demonstration application is provided. Note however that this application
contains the bare minimum \ie{} a \textit{CRT - C Runtime} along with a
dummy function.

Finally, a system library is provided for issuing system call in
an easy way.

\section{Assignments}

% design

\subsection*{Design}

Students are asked to study the different algorithms, data structures,
techniques in order to provide the chosen feature.

% implementation

\subsection*{Implementation}

Students are then asked to implement the service of their choice
along with any extra component required.

Finally, students should provide user-level applications for illustration
purposes.
