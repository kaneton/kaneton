\section{Distributed Operating System}

To understand the kaneton microkernel design and implementation, the reader
must first understand what are the distributed operating systems requirements
and more generally what are distributed systems inherent problems.

A distributed operating system can be defined through different ways and
the reader should probably find different definitions in the literature. In
this document, we assume that the main goal of a distributed operating
system is to connect users and resources in a transparent, open, and scalable
way.

For instance, when a user launches a program, the distributed operating system
decides on which machine of the network to run it. More generally, for
any action performed, the distributed operating system will find the better
place and way to perform it.

Then, while the processes generally communicate with each other on the same
machine, in a distributed operating system, they also communicate with the
other processes of other machines as illustrated in \textit{Figure
\ref{figure:distributed-operating-system}}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{\path/figures/distributed-operating-system.pdf}
    \caption{Communications in a distributed operating system.}
    \label{figure:distributed-operating-system}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

In \textit{Figure \ref{figure:distributed-operating-system}}, the machine
named \textit{E} is running three processes. One is just running some
calculations performing no communication, another is receiving a message
from the latter which is also sending two messages to processes over the
network.

These communications can be simple point-to-point communication for example
between a client and a web server while other can be distributed operating
system specific messages intended to make decisions on the location of a file
on the distributed file system for instance.

We saw that machines on a distributed operating system are running processes
which communicate with any other processes of any other node. Every machine
needs an operating system to organize the computer resources and to make
them communicate.

Microkernel-based operating systems are the best suitable systems
for building a distributed operating system as these systems are modular
and reliable by nature.

\section{Microkernel}

A microkernel is a kernel type designed to be modular. Instead of
building a large binary object containing the kernel itself, the drivers,
the file systems etc. microkernels try to be as small as possible,
providing only the fundamental services for managing memory, execution
contexts, communication and input/output. Then the other classical operating
system services are provided by userland processes with special privileges
called.

This very specific design is very interesting for security, maintainability
and extensibility. Moreover, this type of design perfectly fits
distributed operating systems requirements where special processes
communicate with other node's processes to organize the whole distributed
system resources.

Figure \ref{figure:microkernel} illustrates a microkernel view with different
layers.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{\path/figures/microkernel-behaviour.pdf}
    \caption{Communications in a microkernel's hierarchy.}
    \label{figure:microkernel}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The whole microkernel design is based on the client-server communication
model where clients ask servers to perform a specific task. For instance,
to print some text to the screen a user program has to ask the \textit{tty}
server to do so because the user program itself does not have the permission
to access the video card device.

To avoid complications and deadlocks the microkernel follows a fundamental
rule which restrict communication from clients only to more or equal
privileged tasks. On the Figure \ref{figure:microkernel}, the \textit{vfs}
server can ask the \textit{ata} server and the \textit{kernel} to peform a
task but the kernel cannot ask a less privileged server to do something for
him.
