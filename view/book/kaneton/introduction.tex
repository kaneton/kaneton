The kaneton microkernel research project design and implementation are
described through a number of documents. The first one in the chain is
the present book called \textit{The kaneton microkernel}. This book introduces
the kaneton microkernel project through its goals, design, terminology and so
forth.

The books listed below go further by describing more precisely a specific
component of the kaneton microkernel:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{The kaneton microkernel :: core}

    \-

    That document focuses on the design and implementation of the kaneton
    microkernel core through the different managers;
  \item
    \textbf{The kaneton microkernel :: }\textit{[architecture]}

    \-

    Theses documents tackle the implementation of kaneton on the given
    \textit{[architecture]}. Additionally, these documents contain information
    on platforms coupled with this architecture.

    \-

    These documents can be found in two forms, either public or private.
    Indeed, these documents contain information students must not have
    access to.

    \-

    The architectures, with their platforms, currently documented are
    listed below:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
	\textbf{ia32}: \textit{ibm-pc}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
