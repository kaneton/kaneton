\subsection{Project Management}
\label{section:project management}

It is very important to really well understand that kaneton is a
community-driven project. Hence, people cannot expect to always do what
they would like to as many things need to be done, fixed or whatever.

Additionally, as the project grows, it needs to be more carefully managed
so that bugs are fixed, boring tasks are done \etc{}

A project management tool is provided in order to better manage tasks
according to their priorities. \name{Trac} was picked for this purpose
as it was probably, at that time, the best choice.

The project management tool is running on the \location{kaneton.org} server
and authentication is based on the \name{Wiki}.

Always remember that, although \name{Trac} provides a \name{Wiki} as well,
the \location{kaneton.org} \name{Developers Wiki} must be used instead.
