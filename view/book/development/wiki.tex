\subsection{Wiki}
\label{section:wiki}

A Wiki is used both for external and internal communication. The software
used is called \name{TWiki} and provides a pretty simple syntax with
many additional plugins to customize the website. This solution was used
for historical reasons but also because the \name{TWiki} rendering can
be customized through templates in order to get a final visual close to
classical websites. Thus, the kaneton website looks like an ordinary
website but powered by a Wiki engine.

The Wiki is hosted at \location{http://kaneton.opaak.org} and contains two
webs: an extranet and an intranet. The main web, accessed through the
address above is the external website. This website contains news, papers,
documentation and general information on the kaneton project. The other
web is used more as an intranet or wiki more than as a website.

Finally, \location{http://wiki.opaak.org} is intended to students and contains
documents, links \etc{} about low-level programming, kernel development \etc{}
as well as information about courses related to the \name{opaak} projects.

Everybody involved in the kaneton project must contribute to the kaneton
website as well as to the kaneton intranet and wiki. Indeed, the external
communication is fundamental, even in an open source project and the kaneton
website is the only public communication medium.

New contributors are then asked to register onto the kaneton \name{TWiki}
at \location{http://kaneton.opaak.org}. Once done, the contributor should
inform the person in charge of the kaneton website so that  the contributor's
account is activated. As a result, the contributor will be able to modify
pages of the website and intranets.
