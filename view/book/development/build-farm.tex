\subsection{Build Farm}
\label{section:build farm}

A \textit{Build Farm} was introduced in order to perform a verification
of the correct behaviour of the kaneton microkernel on a daily-basis.

Indeed, every night, the \textit{build-farm} tool is launched on the
\textit{kaneton.org} server and performs the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{checkout} of the kaneton repository;
  \item
    \textbf{compiling} of the kaneton microkernel and its dependencies;
  \item
    \textbf{test} of the microkernel behaviour in an emulated environment.
\end{enumerate}

At the end of the process, the tool reports the results obtained on
the kaneton developers mailing-list.

Thus, if the kaneton microkernel does not pass all the tests, this means
that a modification has introduced some bugs.
