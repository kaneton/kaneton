\section{Overview}

% 1)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introduction}

  \term{kaneton} is an educational project intended for students to undertake
  in order to learn about operating system internals.

  \-

  Note that a research project is also tied to the educational one. Indeed,
  people work in order to improve the microkernel and build a useable
  distributed operating system on top of it.
\end{frame}

% 2)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{History}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item[2004]
      \name{Julien Quintard} and \name{Jean-Pascal Billaud} [EPITA'06] decide
      to introduce an optional low-level programming course to first-year
      enginnering students, now known as \name{kastor};
    \item[2004]
      The course having been well received, \name{SRS - Syst\`emes, R\'eseaux,
      S\'ecurit\'e} students ask them to give such an introduction course the
      same year.
    \item[2005]
      The authorization is given to them to teach an kernel development course
      to \name{SRS} students, from January to October. They therefore decided
      to provide students with the design of a microkernel and let the students
      develop it from scratch, their way. \name{kaneton} was born.
    \item[2006]
      After \name{Jean-Pascal Billaud} fled to \name{VMWare}, \name{Julien
      Quintard} started developing a reference implementation and gave
      students this year a skeleton they had to complete. In addition,
      \name{Cedric Aubouy} and \name{Renaud Lienhart} joined the teaching
      team this year.

      \-

      Besides, the \name{LSE - Laboratoire Syst\`eme EPITA} joined the project
      by putting two students on the development of the \name{kaneton}
      research implementation. \name{Matthieu Bucchianeri} and \name{Renaud
      Voltz} thus joined the project.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% 3)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{History}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item[2007]
      This year, \name{Matthieu Bucchianeri} and \name{Renaud Voltz} took
      over the project for a year by lecturing the course and managing the
      project.

      \-

      \name{Julian Pidancet} and \name{Pierre Duteil} joined the project
      as part of the \name{LSE} but \name{Pierre Duteil} had to leave the
      project. Therefore, \name{Elie Bleton}, who was working at the
      \name{LRDE} before, joined the project.
    \item[2008]
      \name{Julian Pidancet} and \name{Elie Bleton} took over this year
      while \name{Laurent Lec} and \name{Nicolas Grandemange} joined as part
      of the \name{LSE}.

      \-

      At the end of this year, after problems with students and the \name{LSE},
      \name{kaneton} maintainers decided not to work with the \name{LSE}
      anymore.
    \item[2009]
      \name{EPITA} alumni were contacted and joined the educational project
      including \name{Francois Goudal}, \name{Benoit Marcot},
      \name{Jean Guyader} and \name{Frank Curo} but also
      \name{Fabien Le-Mentec}, an \name{EPITECH} alumnus.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% 4)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Changes}

  Over the years, the project has greatly evolved, from a no-implementation
  project, to a reference-based project but also through the assignments.

  \-

  However, being a project developed by volunteers willing to dedicate some
  time so that other students can learn, many things are missing and/or
  can be improved including the lectures but also the project implementation.

  \-

  In conclusion, keep in mind that the project exist because of people
  willing to pass their knowledge to students.
\end{frame}

% 5)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Model}

  The project consists for students to fill in some missing parts of the
  kernel.

  \-

  However, note that, unlike \name{Tiger}, the missing parts will never
  be two lines long.

  \-

  Indeed, in \name{kaneton}, students are asked to implement a feature, say,
  providing memory management. Thus, students are free, in a certain way,
  to implement such a feature the way they want.
\end{frame}

% 6)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{People}

  Let's present the people working on the educational project from where they
  studied to what they are now doing:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \name{Francois Goudal};
    \item
      \name{Benoit Marcot};
    \item
      \name{Jean Guyader};
    \item
      \name{Fabien Le-Mentec};
    \item
      \name{Frank Curo}; and
    \item
      \name{Julien Quintard}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% 7)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Project}

  \name{kaneton} is an important assignments in the \name{SRS}/\name{GISTR}
  curriculum and, as such, must be taken seriously.

  \-

  Especially, in the last years, \name{EPITA} decided to reduce the duration
  of the project to $3$ months.

  \-

  As such, the other assignments imposed by the specializations in this
  period have been reduced so that students can focus on \name{kaneton}.
