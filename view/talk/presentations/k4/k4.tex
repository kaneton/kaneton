\section{Introduction}

% 1)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Overview}

  \name{k4} is a stage that can be considered as \term{open}.

  \-

  Indeed, total freedom is given to students regarding the design and
  implementation of this project.
\end{frame}

% 2)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Objective}

  The goal of this project is for students to design and implement a
  file system.

\section{Assignments}

% 1)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Design}

  The first task consists for students to design the file system by studying
  the different algorithms and techniques.
\end{frame}

% 2)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Interface}

  The students file system is not meant to comply to any pre-defined interface.

  \-

  As such, students willing to study the limitations of well-known interfaces
  such as \name{POSIX} in order to define a new one could be granted points
  according to the solution they propose.
\end{frame}

% 3)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Implementation}

  Once the file system designed, students will have to implement it by
  taking care of providing a few illustrating applications.

  \-

  Indeed, no test application is provided as total freedom is given to
  students regarding the file system interface.
\end{frame}

%
% evaluation
%

\section{Evaluation}

% 1)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Viva}

  During the viva, students will have to first describe their choices in
  terms of design before detailling what problems they encountered afterwards
  regarding the previously sketched design.

  \-

  The file system interface and user-level applications should also be
  discussed, though quite briefly.

  \-

  The viva will last for $10$ minutes with possibly $5$ minutes for questions.
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion}

% 1)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Freedom}

  The main objective of this stage is to give students total control over
  a well-defined functionality.

  \-

  Students should therefore take advantage of this freedom to think about
  people did previously in terms of file system design including the well-known
  \name{ext2}, \name{ext3}, \name{FAT}, \name{ReiserFS} and so forth.
