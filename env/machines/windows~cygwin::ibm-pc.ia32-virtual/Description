This machine profile is based on Windows' Cygwin so on GNU tools.

This machine profile was tested with:

  Windows XP, Cygwin 1.5.22-1, binutils 2.17 and gcc 4-2

This machine profile is based on specific tools to generate ELF binaries.

Indeed, to use this profile you should first install a cross-compiler
since Cygwin natively produces COFF files.

To do so, you need to build the binutils and gcc tools for the
i686-pc-elf target.

Below, a list of the programs this machine profile uses.

  bash.exe
  i686-pc-elf-gcc.exe
  make.exe
  rm.exe
  i686-pc-elf-ar.exe
  i686-pc-elf-ranlib.exe
  cd
  i686-pc-elf-ld.exe
  nasm.exe
  ln.exe
  touch.exe
  wc.exe
  date.exe
  tail.exe
  tar.exe
  pdflatex.exe
  cp.exe
  cat.exe
  sed.exe
  echo.exe
  read
  ls.exe
  i686-pc-elf-cpp.exe
  mtools.exe
  mcopy.exe
  grep.exe
  mkdir.exe
  find.exe
  xpdf.exe
  mktemp.exe
  mv.exe
  pwd.exe
  flex.exe
  script.exe
  perl.exe
  python.exe
  which.exe

Of course, depending of your status, student or kaneton reference developer,
some binaries should be needless.
