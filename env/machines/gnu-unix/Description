This machine profile is based on GNU tools.

If your operating system also used GNU tools, then you can certainly
use this machine profile.

Below, a list of the program this machine profile uses.

For more information, take a look at the machine.conf file.

Moreover, remember the user profile can override machine profile's
variables. The user could so override for example the _SHELL_ variable
to its specific bash binary path.

  bash
  gcc
  gmake
  rm
  ar
  ranlib
  cd
  ld
  nasm
  ln
  touch
  wc
  date
  tail
  tar
  pdflatex
  cp
  cat
  sed
  echo
  read
  ls
  cpp
  mtools
  mcopy
  grep
  mkdir
  find
  xpdf
  mktemp
  mv
  pwd
  lex
  script

Of course, depending of your status, student or kaneton reference developer,
some binaries should be needless.
