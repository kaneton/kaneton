This machine profile is based on Linux and the GNU tools but generates
binaries and libraries for a 64-bit MIPS microprocessor machine.

Below, a list of the program this machine profile uses.

For more information, take a look at the machine.conf file.

Moreover, remember the user profile can override machine profile's
variables. The user could so override for example the _SHELL_ variable
to its specific bash binary path.

  bash
  mips64-gcc
  gmake
  rm
  mips64-ar
  mips64-ranlib
  cd
  mips64-ld
  mips64-as
  ln
  touch
  wc
  date
  tail
  tar
  pdflatex
  cp
  cat
  sed
  echo
  read
  ls
  mips64-cpp
  mtools
  mcopy
  grep
  mkdir
  find
  xpdf
  mktemp
  mv
  pwd
  lex
  script
  perl
  python

Of course, depending of your status, student or kaneton reference developer,
some binaries should be needless.

If the user wants to use the development environment to build and display
the kaneton documents via the command 'make view', he should define
a shell function called 'view()' which takes a document as argument and then
displays it.

Below, an example of such a function defined in the file 'user.sh' of the
user profile.

   #
   # VIEW
   #
   # this function opens and displays a document.
   #
   view()
   {
     local document=${1}

     ${VIEWER} ${document}
   }
