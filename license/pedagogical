TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

0.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this License. The "Program", below, refers
    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".


1.  You must not copy or distribute copies of the Program's source
    code, object code or executable form without explicit authorization
    from the maintainers.
    If you have this authorization, you must conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer
    to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
    other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
    the Program.


2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, provided that you
    meet all of these conditions :

      a. You must not publish your work without explicit authorization
      from the maintainers.

      b. You must send to the maintainers any work that in whole or in
      part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof.

      c. You must cause any work that you send, that in whole or in
      part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
      to be licensed as a whole under the terms of this License.

      d. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      e. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
      provide a warranty) and telling the user how to view a copy
      of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
      but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based
      on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)


3.  Access to the Program's source is granted if either:

      a. You want to make the Program evolve

      b. You have pedagogical goals


    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.


4.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
    License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
    from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.


5.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
    or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
    are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
    License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
    any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
    copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
    it.


6.  Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
    to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
    herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
    parties to this License.


8.  If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
    the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
    excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
    in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
    incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
    License.


9.  We may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from
    time to time. It may evolve considering new contributors
    needs. Contact us if you have any request. Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
    detail to address new problems or concerns.


10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
    author to ask for permission, we sometimes make exceptions for this.


NO WARRANTY

11. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
    COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
    RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
    MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
    LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
    INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
    OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
    OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
