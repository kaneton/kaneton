The configuration files contain a configuration which will be used in order
to generate the initial user's database.

These files contain a set of quota which is composed of various test
configuration. Every test configuration is identified through its
environment (qemu, xen etc.), the platform/architecture couple, often
referred to as the machine (ibm-pc.ia32/educational etc.) and the test
suite the user is allowed to trigger in this test configuration (k1, k2
etc.).

The user is allowed to trigger the test suite of a given configuration a
limited number of times, given by the quota. Note that a quota of -1
indicates an infinite number of requests allowed.

The _reports_ section will contain, in the database, the reports associated
with a test suite having been triggered.

Finally, the _deliveries_ section will contain the snapshots submitted
by the user for a specific stage (k1, k2 etc.).

NOTE! The suites and stages are named after each other (k0, k1, k2 etc.)
      but are completely different notions since the stage, say k2, could
      very well trigger both the k1 and k2 test suites.
