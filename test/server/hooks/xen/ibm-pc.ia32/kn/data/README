This directory contains everything necessary for building the compile SVM.

The Xen configuration file 'svm.cfg' provided is not used by the test
system but can be used for launching the compiling SVM out of the box:

  $> xm create svm:debug.cfg -c

The virtualized operating system can be anything but should be as
small as possible while providing everthing necessary to the kaneton
environment to compile.

The compile.sh script is the once launched at the startup that
takes the snapshot image (sdb1), extract it, compile it and
return an image.
