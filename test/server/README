The server side of the test system is composed of two scripts which
then trigger other scripts located in the scripts/ directory.

Note that both scripts must be launched in order for the server to work.

#
# ---------- registrar --------------------------------------------------------
#

The registrar waits for incoming requests enabling the clients to list their
reports, consult a report, submit a final snapshot for a given stage or
even trigger a test suite in order to validate an implementation.

In this last case, the provided snapshot is saved, its report is set up
so as to include all the metadata information and the test is scheduled
by adding the snapshot identifier to the scheduler's queue.

#
# ---------- scheduler --------------------------------------------------------
#

The scheduler script waits for identifier to be recorded in the queue. When
this occurs, the report is loaded in order to retrieve the metadata such
as the testing environment, the test suite to trigger and so forth. The
snapshot is then extracted, a bootable image is generated and the test
suite is launched.

In the end, an email is sent to the user so as to inform her of the
availability of the test report.

In addition, the scheduler triggers some hooks, located in the hooks/
directory. Please refer to the README file for more information on those
hooks.

#
# ---------- server.sh --------------------------------------------------------
#

This shell scripts spawns both the previous scripts.
