The stage files specify grading rules through a set a configurations
associated with tests.

Every test configuration specifies the emulated environment in which the
image construction and kernel stressing process must occur, along with the
platform and architecture of the kernel to test. The suite indicates the
test suite to use for the stressing process. Finally, the weight attribute
indicates how important this configuration is in the final grade.

For every configuration, the kaneton snapshot is tested after the given
test suite, leading to a set of reports. For every report and every
successful test, points are added to the grade.
