The robot enables the contributors to be notified of the state of the current
research implementation.

The robot script starts by retrieving the current kaneton implementation by
checking-out the kaneton repository. For this purpose, the SSH keys located
in the robot/ directory are used. Note that the 'config' SSH file must be
placed in the ~/.ssh/ directory so that, whenever the script request a
Subversion operation, the correct keys are used along with the proper user
identity.

Once the repository checked-out, the script initialize the environment
and triggers a test through the test client script located in the kaneton
directory.

Since the address email registered within the robot's capability is the
kaneton contributors' mailing-list, an email is sent to the mailing-list
summarising the testing of the kaneton research implementation.

Note that the robot script logs information. Therefore, a directory
store/log/ must be available for logs to be created and updated.
