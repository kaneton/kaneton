# ---------- overview ---------------------------------------------------------
#

The security of the test system is ensured though the use of cryptographic
techniques.

The nomenclature is as below:

  key: a RSA key pair
  certificate: a X509 certificate
  code: a random string
  capability: a HMAC-protected collection of items

The opaak certification authority provides a certificate for the domain
test.opaak.org with the email address admin@opaak.org. This ultime authority
is used to generate sub-certificates.

The first sub-certificate to be issued is for the server to run the test
system. This certificate is therefore sealed by the opaak CA. Note that the
certificates are used to identify valid test servers. The users are
authentified through capabilities as explained next.

The capabilities provides their owner the possibility to trigger test suites
on the test server. Every capability is secured by a HMAC performed with a
randomly generated server-specific code.

Every time a test is requested on the server, the provided capability is
verified before proceeding. Once run, the server increments the number of
tests requested from the user by updating the user's personal database.

A database is a file containing, for every test environment i.e machine
provided by the server, a set of test suites the user is allowed to trigger.
For every test suite is recorded the number of tests requested along with
the maximum number of tests the user is allowed to perform, after which every
request will be denied.

#
# ---------- scripts ----------------------------------------------------------
#

This directory contains scripts for generating the access tokens required
for testing the kaneton microkernel.

First, the authority certificate must be generated so that it can be
used to sign the users' capabilities. Note that a certificate for the
server is also generated.

  $> make certificate

Then, a random code is generated so that capabilities cannot be forged.

  $> make code

The students' and contributor's capabilities are generated for a specific
school and year, through the following command line.

  $> make capability-school@epita::2010
  $> make capability-group@epita::2010:group8
  $> make capability-student@epita::2010:group8
  $> make capability-contributor
  $> make capability-robot

Finally, the databases containing the current state of the tests as well
as the limit for every stage are generated according to the configurations
found in test/configuration/

  $> make database-school@epita::2009
  $> make database-group@epita::2009:group2
  $> make database-student@epita::2009:group2
  $> make database-contributor
  $> make database-robot

Note that the inventory.py script is used elsewhere in the tests/ directory
in order to generate an array containing the addresses of the tests. This
array is then included in the source code and linked with the kernel.
