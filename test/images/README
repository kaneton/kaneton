This directory contains everything for generating a Debian Live system.

The 'debian.sh' script must be run on a Debian system and generated a
_debian.iso_ file containing the necessary for a kaneton snapshot to be
compiled.

Note that the Debian Live system expects a disk to be provided through the
/dev/hdb device.

For more information, one can have a look at the data/ directory which contains
the files that will be included in the generated Debian Live system.

The etc::init.d::kaneton.sh script is triggered at the bootup. This script
mounts and copies a few files from the /dev/hdb device before launching
a sub-script, the home::user:compile.sh, under the identity of a specific
unprivileged user.

Note that the etc::init.d::live-initramfs.patch contains the necessary to
make sure the Debian Live system halts automatically without the need for
a user to hit a key.
