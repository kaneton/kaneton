name: core/as/copy/02
description: This test creates two tasks, every one with its address space. Several non-adjacent segments are first allocated and then adjacently mapped. Then, data is written to the first task's address space, copied to the other address space---with some offsets---before being read and verified. Finally, every resource is released.
