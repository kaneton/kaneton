This directory contains tests that will be triggered either manually
or through the test system. Every test is composed of one or more functions
though one will act as the test entry point and a test manifest which
describes the test. The following gives an example of the multiple fileds
the test system expect to find in those manifests:

  name: A unique name for the test such as 'core/task/kernel'
  description: A description of the test so that students and contributors can
               understand what this test does
  symbol: The name of the test's function entry point such as
           'test_core_task_kernel'
  signature: A random sequence that the test is supposed to generate
  output: The output of the test
  points: The number of points in the range [1, 5] that are assigned
          to this test. Note that the difficulty must be evaluated according
	  to the tests of the same manager i.e the number of points cannot
	  be used to compare the difficulty between core/id/reserve/01 and
	  scheduler/complete/02
  timeout: the timeout in seconds depending on the environment.
