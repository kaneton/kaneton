I am really furious again myself, unable to finish the project in the
given time... the compression algorithm isn't ok but their aren't many
stuffs to achieve it... Nevertheless, untarring is alright.

I really hope I'll be allowed to go in stage next year (moreover the
company has already accepted me !).
Have a look to my Kernel project please, my skills in C and Unix are written
in it !

See you next year, I hope not in the swimming pool.
