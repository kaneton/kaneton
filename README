kaneton
=======

[**kaneton**](http://kaneton.opaak.org) is a microkernel that has been
designed for building flexible, reliable and secure operating systems.

Its design includes many modern paradigms while being written in a
real-world low-level programming language: C.

This microkernel has been designed to be ported on many architectures
without being intrusive. Moreover, the main goal of this system was
to be understandable by everyone interested in operating systems
internals.

As such, the kaneton design and implementation are very elegant and
easy to understand. The kaneton microkernel includes modern distributed
system concepts leading to a powerful microkernel based operating system.

More information can be found in this
[article](http://www.osnews.com/story/15018/The-kaneton-Microkernel-Project/)
submitted as part of OSNews' operating system contests in which kaneton competed.

One can find additional details about kaneton's architecture on the official
website: http://kaneton.opaak.org.

kaneton has been used as the main material for last-year students in
french engineering schools, most specifically [EPITA](http://www.epita.fr),
to teach operating system internals, low-level development, microprocessor
theory and more.

_NOTE: kaneton is no longer maintained and has been, as a result, open
sourced. Feel free to use it as teaching material if you want._
